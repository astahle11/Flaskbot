2025-02-09 01:41:08,289 - These messages indicate that you're running your Python application in debug mode, likely using a framework like Flask or Django.  The `socket.io` messages suggest you're also using a library for real-time web communication.

Here's how to get rid of the debug messages:

1. **Disable the Debugger:**

   The most direct way is to disable the debugger.  How you do this depends on your framework:

   * **Flask:**  Set `app.run(debug=False)` or remove `debug=True` if it's already there.  If you're starting your app through a command like `flask run`, use `flask run --no-debug`.

   * **Django:**  Remove `DEBUG = True` from your `settings.py` file.  Django's runserver (development server) automatically enables debugging when `DEBUG = True`.

2. **Environment Variables (For Production):**

   For production deployments, it's best practice to use environment variables to control the debug mode. This avoids accidentally leaving debug mode on in a live environment.

   ```python
   import os

   # Flask example
   DEBUG = os.environ.get("DEBUG", False)  # Defaults to False if not set
   app.run(debug=DEBUG)

   # Django example (in settings.py)
   DEBUG = os.environ.get("DEBUG", False)
   ```

   Then, you can set the `DEBUG` environment variable to `True` or `1` only when you need debugging.

3. **Logging Configuration (For More Granular Control):**

   If you want more fine-grained control over logging, configure your logging settings to suppress debug messages.  This is useful if you want to keep some logging enabled but not the debugger output.

   ```python
   import logging

   # Basic example (adjust level as needed)
   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)  # This will suppress DEBUG messages

   # More advanced example (configure loggers, handlers, and formatters)
   log = logging.getLogger('werkzeug') # For Flask's development server
   log.setLevel(logging.ERROR)

   # Or for a specific logger in your application
   my_logger = logging.getLogger('my_app')
   my_logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
   ```

**Socket.IO Messages:**

The `socket.io` messages are separate from the debugger messages. They indicate normal communication between the client and server.  You wouldn't typically want to suppress these entirely, as they represent client interactions.

However, if you want to reduce the volume of these logs, you can adjust the logging level for the `socketio` logger (if your library uses it):

```python
import logging

socketio_log = logging.getLogger('socketio')
socketio_log.setLevel(logging.WARNING) # Or logging.ERROR for even less output
```

Remember to consult the documentation for your specific `socket.io` library for details on its logging configuration.


By following these steps, you can control the debug and `socket.io` messages and keep your console output clean and relevant to your current needs.  Always disable debugging in production environments!
