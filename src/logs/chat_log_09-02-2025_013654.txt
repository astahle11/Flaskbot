2025-02-09 01:37:01,013 - Nice cope
2025-02-09 01:37:03,346 - "Cope" is often used online to suggest someone is dealing with disappointment or failure in an unhealthy way, by creating a false narrative or justification.  Is there something specific you'd like to discuss or debate?  Perhaps you'd like to share your perspective on why you used that term?
2025-02-09 01:37:37,673 - How can I suppress Flask python info level logging print outs?
2025-02-09 01:37:54,700 - You can suppress Flask's info-level logging output in several ways:

**1. Setting the Logging Level:**

This is the most common and recommended approach.  You configure the root logger or the Flask app's logger to only handle messages at a level higher than INFO (e.g., WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).

```python
from flask import Flask
import logging

app = Flask(__name__)

# Method 1: Set the level of the Flask app's logger
app.logger.setLevel(logging.WARNING)  # Or logging.ERROR, logging.CRITICAL

# Method 2: Set the level of the root logger (affects all loggers)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.WARNING) # Or logging.ERROR, logging.CRITICAL

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    app.logger.info("This will NOT be printed")  # Info level
    app.logger.warning("This WILL be printed") # Warning level
    return "Hello, World!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True) # Even in debug mode, INFO won't be printed
```

**2. Using a `NullHandler`:**

A `NullHandler` effectively discards all log messages sent to it.  This is useful if you want to completely silence a specific logger.

```python
from flask import Flask
import logging

app = Flask(__name__)

# Create a NullHandler and add it to the app's logger
null_handler = logging.NullHandler()
app.logger.addHandler(null_handler)

# ... rest of your app code
```

**3. Modifying the `debug` flag (less recommended):**

Setting `app.run(debug=False)` will suppress INFO messages, but it also disables the debugger and automatic reloading.  This is generally not the preferred method unless you specifically want to disable these features in production.  It's better to control logging levels directly.

```python
app.run(debug=False)
```

**4. Customizing the Logging Formatter (for finer control):**

You can create a custom `Formatter` to filter out specific messages or format them differently.  This gives you more granular control but is generally overkill for simply suppressing INFO messages.

```python
import logging
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

handler = logging.StreamHandler()
formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s') # Customize format
handler.setFormatter(formatter)
app.logger.addHandler(handler)
app.logger.setLevel(logging.WARNING) # Still set the level

# ... rest of your app code
```


**Choosing the Right Approach:**

* For most cases, setting the logging level using `app.logger.setLevel(logging.WARNING)` or `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.WARNING)` is the simplest and most effective solution.
* Use a `NullHandler` if you need to completely silence a specific logger without affecting others.
* Avoid relying solely on `debug=False` for logging control, as it also affects other debugging features.


Remember to choose the method that best suits your needs and provides the right balance between simplicity and control over your logging output.  Using appropriate logging levels is crucial for maintaining a clean and informative log, especially in production environments.
