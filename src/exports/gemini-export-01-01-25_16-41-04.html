      <br>You: cd c:/vscode/python/tools/chatCLI/src/ui<br><br>Bot: That command changes the current directory to `c:/vscode/python/tools/chatCLI/src/ui` within your terminal or command prompt.  There's no output from the command itself unless there's an error (e.g., the directory doesn't exist).  If successful, your subsequent commands will be executed relative to that new directory.<br>
